## Instructions to run the Server

Please run the backend server first.

To run the frontend application in development mode, run `ng serve`

The Frontend Application will make API calls to `http://127.0.0:8000`

If the backend runs on another port, please provide the correct url in the  `/src/environments/entironment.ts` and  `/src/environments/entironment.prod.ts` 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Linter

Run `ng lint` to execute the linter.
